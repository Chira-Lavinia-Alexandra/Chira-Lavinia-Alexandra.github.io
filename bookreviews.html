                    <h3 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>“A Mercy”. Between loneliness and race in a New World</strong></h3>
                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">With Morrison’s book, one is faced with an enthralling story about the mercy of a human gesture. The title sends neither to a world overflowing with acts of kindness nor to the numerous versions of God’s infinite mercy. Here, Morrison captures the all-loving gesture of a desperate mother, who offered her daughter into slavery hoping that she would have a better life.
<br>
<br>
<br>The complexity of Morrison’s writing goes far beyond this gesture of offering.  Morrison tells the story of four women bought by the Dutch landlord Jacob Vaark. Morison’s readers must get quickly used to the disruptive narratives told from the perspective of multiple narrators.
<br>
<br>The timeframe of this novel is the 1680s, when slavery was in its early stages. Back then, not only black people were enslaved, but also Native Americans and Europeans shared the same fate. Morrison brings us back to a moment in time when the whites traded their liberty to set their foot on the newly discovered land.
<br>
<br>Four female voices are here the main characters: Lina, a traumatised Native-American; Florens, the enslaved girl who is at the story’s center; Sorrow, a bad omen bringing child; and Rebekka, their European `Mistress` who was sold by her mother to Vaark to be his wife. Something worth observing here is that all of the characters were emotionally abandoned.
<br>
<br> A Mercy is a story about the excruciating loneliness and alienation felt by the orphans of the New World while they discovered their path. Those familiarised with Morrison’s writings can detect the almost supernatural relations between the four main female characters. From foes, Rebekka and Lina build up a mutual affection that helps them to survive the vicious New World. From a childless mother, Lina instantly adopts Florens, a girl given into slavery by her mãe (mother). As Ulaby (2008) beautifully stated in her article for NPR, there is a “transformative maternity” that defines the novel. Each character helps the others grow and survive.
<br>
<br>Jacob Vaark is the main male figure in the novel. He is an ex “ratty orphan” (p. 10) who become a landlord in the New World through an unexpected inheritance. He is the embodiment of love, protection and unity. His glance lacks both carnal and animal desire. Out of mercy, he creates a strange female community on his land. He buys Lina from some kind Presbyterians so she can teach him how to take care of the farm. Lina is a natural healer and still has some basic knowledge about the culture of her people. Abandoned twice, she found her refuge in nature. Thus, to diminish the feeling of loneliness “[s]he cawed with birds, chatted with plants, spoke to squirrels, sang to cows and opened her mouth to rain. The shame of having survived the destruction of her families shrank with her vow never to betray or abandon anyone she cherished”(p. 47).
<br>
<br>Lina lost her tribe because of smallpox, then she was never fully accepted by her new community of Presbyterians. When Vaark bought her, they barely “whispered” their farewell which for Lina translated as a second abandonment. As a result, once she reaches her new home, she instantly adopts the small Florens, and in addition to her, both Rebekka and Vaark.
<br>
<br>Even if Florens was instantly loved by Lina, she can never get over the gesture made by her mother. It was that poisonous loneliness caused by her mother’s abandonment that leads her to find her refuge in the arms of the blacksmith who is manufacturing the iron gates for Vaark’s new house. Their relationship is wild, based on carnal desire. Once the blacksmith discovers the wilderness hidden in her soul, he abandons her. This second abandonment drives Florens mad. She discovers that she is “only a leaf in his three”. Driven by sorrow, she starts to write her story on the walls of the house in a desperate attempt to reach her mother.
<br>
<br>Vaark buys Rebekka, “a [h]ardy female, Christianized and capable in all matters domestic available for exchange of goods or species” (p. 49). Their evolution in the novel is strongly shadowed by the loss of their children. They start to retreat from society in a selfish attempt to protect themselves. This way they start to be blinded by the building of a new house, and fail to observe the future perils which are bound to bring their lives to a miserable end.
<br>
<br>Sorrow is the third slave bought by Vaark. She attracts misery, pain and it feels like the only place where she can find love, is in the arms of her imaginary twin, called Twin. There is no place for her under the sun, and there is no tender hand to show her love. She is astonished when she sees Florens being kissed by the blacksmith, as her sexual encounters had been lacking such affection.
<br>
<br>In A Mercy Morrison’s characters undergo a journey of self-discovery. They discover that they are perceived as the Other, “the negrita”. They do not belong to the New Land. They were bought because of their blackness, to serve, to gather, to please and to suffer.
<br>
<br>I was burning sweat in cane only a short time when they took me away to sit on a platform in the sun. It was there I learned how I was not a person from my country, nor from my families. I was negrita. Everything. Language, dress, gods, dance, habits, decoration, song—all of it cooked together in the color of my skin (p. 157)
<br>
<br>To the Presbyterian, the blackness of the Other is Satanic. Florens, for example, is held captive by some superstitious Presbyterians who think that she is the Black Man’s minion. It is because of her pitch-black skin that people search her nakedness for any Satanic sign. A man’s whip searches between her legs, others check if her knees bend backward and some examine her to see if her tongue is split like that of snakes. Florens is alone in her blackness.
<br>
<br>Florens’ mother (tua mae) sees in Vaark the opposite of Senhor. She sees that there “was no animal in his hearth” (p. 155). For a “negrita” there is no protection in the hands of an owner like Senhor. To be a female on his land was like “an opened wound that cannot heal” (ibidem). Vaark is the miracle tua mae had been hoping for. However, this miracle had not been “bestowed by God […] It was a mercy. Offered by a man.” (p. 158). One day, Florens will get to discover the truth that her mother was aware of: “to be given dominion over another is a hard thing; to wrest dominion over another is a wrong thing; to give dominion of yourself to another is a wicked thing” (p. 158).
<br>
<br>Morrison’s plot turns out to be a multi-faceted story of the story Lina tells Florens. Just as the dead eagle’s eggs, they, as orphans have to hatch alone. As usual, her writing blew my mind. I am still awed by how poetically she shaped this New World. The ending chapter cyclically ended the book and gave meaning to what Morrison tried to do with the structure of the book.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend it? A thousand times over.

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This was the first encounter with Kazuo Ishiguro’s writings. He has this incredible ability to create a dystopian world that is oddly familiar. 
<br>
<br>AIs are artificial friends/ companions available for the elites. Their role is to keep the children company and to help them during homeschooling. Two of these AIs are Rosa and Klara. The first seems unwilling to learn about human behavior,and she operates on the principle “there is no war in Ba Sing Se”. Why? she has never paid attention to the negative in humans. She keeps fantasizing about the perfect family and the perfect child. Klara, on the other hand, keeps learning about love, sadness, anger, and sacrifice. As a narrator, she is naive, hyper-observant, and she manages to see beyond the surface of her owners. 
<br>
<br>*
<br> “Do you believe in the human heart? I don’t mean simply the organ, obviously. I’m speaking in the poetic sense. The human heart. Do you think there is such a thing? Something that makes each of us special and individual?” 
<br>
<br>I liked the slow-paced style of the book. Even if the book may seem a futile reading, it turns out that it challenges the topics of human nature and moral ethics.<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I loved being a customer at Funiculi Funicula. You take your book, a cup of coffee and you wait for the ghost to get out off that chair.
<br>
<br>The style is clean and simple just like any other piece of Japanese literature. The simpler, the better. The title already gives you the main rule of time travel. Move your ass off that chair before the coffee gets cold! Or else?! Oh well, maybe you're going to be the next sassy, humorless ghost sitting in it. 
<br>
<br>The concept of time travel is pure and innocent, virtually useless. You cannot leave the chair while you time travel, you cannot change the future, you can only meet the people who visited the coffee shop. What's the whole point then?!
<br>You cannot fix a mistake, but you can fix yourself, or you can make peace with those who hurt you.
<br>
<br>The chair is a key to your weaknesses and to your unconsciousness.<br></p>

<br>In this book you get to see the world through the eyes of an almost-eight-years-old girl called Elsa. If you ask her Granny, it is common knowledge that every seven-years-old deserves a superhero. If you don't believe me, look it up, it's on Wikipedia!
<br>
<br>Maybe Elsa is young, but she understands the world better than the adults around her. Adults have a penchant to make everything super complicated. Everything is simple as long as people stop having secrets.
<br>
<br>Elsa's granny, to put it mildly, is eccentric. However, she loves her granddaughter and she took her to the Land-of-Almost-Awake. There you are somewhere between dull reality and fantasy world. The more you read, the more you understand that granny was preparing Elsa to face the challenges of the real world. She helped Elsa understand the sadness of the sea angel, the reason why the princess was always saying no, and why one old Britt-Marie was such a pain. Once you know them, and once you listen, you cannot hate them. Why? Because you understand them.
<br> 
<br>Granny was the best at being a granny. She nailed that job. She was always there to protect her niece. She went so far to throw monkey poo in the policemen for Elsa's sake.
<br>
<br>Wiesel said that "friendship is never anything but sharing". I found this particular quote as the best way to describe the purpose of the Land-of-Almost-Awake</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">"A man called Ove" is a peculiar novel about life and death. You will have the chance to meet Ove, a 59-year-old Swedish man, a curmudgeon, who has lost his beloved wife and his job.
<br>
<br>Ove considers that he is surrounded by idiots unable to understand staunch principles, strict routines, and the lifetime fidelity to a car brand. Nowadays, there are only mutt-loving blond bimbos and joggers that run like they are curing “pulmonary emphysema”. People do not care anymore about the old proper ways of doing things right.
<br>
<br>This deceptive premise is used by Backman to craft the complex character of Ove. He will take you behind the persona of a grumpy old man and he will show you all the events that stand behind today’s Ove. You will hear stories about love, friendship, family, and love.
<br>
<br>At the heart of the matter is the grief of losing “[A]ll the color he had.” Backman will explore the way in which Ove was changed by the death of his wife. Will Ove succeed in taking his own life while those new blunt neighbors constantly interrupt him?
<br>
<br>Just prepare yourself to be filled with joy, sorrow and a grief that will connect you to someone who doesn’t exist but who will leave an imprint, nonetheless.

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Murakami is by far one of my favorites writers. I was used to reading his novels; however, his short narratives surpassed all my expectations. Ok, guys, are you ready? In seven short stories, Murakami will show you how men are without women.
<br>
<br>“You are a pastel-colored Persian carpet, and loneliness is a Bordeaux wine stain that won’t come out,” – you are lonely, cold, and absent, like the moon made out of ice from the short story “Yesterday”.
<br>
<br>You are here to see seven empty worlds. Kafuku is a widowed actor who befriends the secret lover of his dead wife. Kitaru loves to translate Beatles lyrics in Japanese, and cannot go all the way with his girlfriend. Tokai became the skeleton figure from his Holocaust book because one of his many mistresses decided to marry another guy. Habara is a single man under a strange house arrest who has mystical sex with his housekeeper, Scheherazade. Kino divorces his wife, opens a bar in the countryside, and meets the woman who will make him vanish. Gregor Samsa, in a reversed "The Metamorphosis," has no sense of self. He has a boner when seeing the hunchbacked female locksmith. In the last story, there is a nameless man who finds out, in the middle of the night, that M committed suicide.
<br>
<br>The realism of these stories is unsettling, dark … it’s like a sad, lovelorn soufflé. You will get to see how lethal loneliness can be.</p>

I feel a constant urge to yell why, Jonathan Safran Foer, why do you do all this to me? The novel is fragmented, and when I say fragmented, I mean FRAGMENTED.
<br>
<br>There is the story of Alex and Jonathan, the story of Trachimbrod’s people, the story of Grandfather and Herschel. Moreover, there are stories within the stories about Jonathan’s great great great great great grandmother and her 613 sadnesses. Who are all these people?

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Today I'm going to show you a different kind of book. It's going to be "NOSTALGISK ORDBOK". You might wonder, what is so fascinating about this dictionary?
<br>
<br>Well, it's not only a dictionary. These nostalgic words are memory triggers that bring old experiences back to life.
<br>
<br>Petter Wilhelm Blichfeldt Schjerven, in collaboration with others, created a dictionary of the good old times. Here you can find words from 1947, words that are still used, or words that are going to be out of use.
<br>
<br>In contrast to a normal dictionary, the words get explained with the personal touch of the author.
<br>
<br>My curiosity is, do you have any strange, fancy, out-of-the-normal dictionary that you will like to share?</p>

                        <strong>THE KITE RUNNER</strong></h3>
                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Kite runner was the first book I read by Khaled Hosseini. I remember running my hands over the cover, over the embossed letters that read, The Kite Runner. I was anticipating a different story.
<br>
<br>I was expecting a story about two boys who grew old together in an ever-lasting friendship. Well, Hosseini took care to shock and impress the reader. He gave his readers more than they could carry.
<br>
<br>This story was about Amir and Hassan, two young boys who experienced two different realities. Amir, part of the Sunni ruling class, was an educated young boy who had everything he needed. However, he lacked the love of his father. Hassan, on the other hand, was part of the Shia lower class. He was the son of a prostitute and a household servant who received all the attention from Amir's father. Up to a point, these boys were best friends, and Hassan truly loved Amir and was proud to call himself his friend. But cracks started to appear when kites flew no more.
<br>
<br>One blue kite, a dark corner in the alley, fear to confront the truth – this was the perfect recipe to bring sadness and darkness in the hearts of 4 men. What happened on that alley followed Amir for the rest of his adult days. Was there a way to repent? Was it possible to ask for the forgiveness of the one you loved the most and cowardly betrayed? Was it possible for your soul to become light as a kite again and to raise it in the sky of Kabul?</p>

You've been there before- you can hear the hum, the waves, the jazz, you can smell the cinnamon, the citrus, the salty water of the sea. You can feel the driving force of love.
<br>
<br>Soon after, the central male figure, Mr. Cosey dies. Mirrors get shattered, beds are set on fire, legs get spread open, dreams get crushed, and hearts get torn apart. Welcome, to the dark side of love.
<br>
<br>You will follow the lives of the women touched by Cosey's love. He was a Father, a Friend, a Portrait, a Stranger, a Benefactor, a Lover, a Husband, a Guardian, and a Phantom. He was an unreachable object of desire. You will see how Heed and Christine became the worst enemies because for the love of one man. It will be difficult to read and understand Morrison, but no worries, L will whisper everything to you. She will whisper and hum about love, something that is divine and difficult at the same time.</p>

<br>
<br>This is a story about the lifelong journey of two girls, Mariam and Laila from two contrasting social backgrounds. It is a novel about true love, faith, and friendships. Mariam grows up marginalized in a brutal world where the conditions of her birth make her a harami. As a child, she had lived with a false image of her father, and with a mother ruled by a jinni. After years of living in a violent, arranged marriage, she meets Laila, who will change her entire life. Will Mariam find peace? Will she ever be loved? Will she ever escape from the Talibans’ ruling fist?
<br>
<br>Hosseini's novel gave me the impression of looking through a peephole and seeing a world in which one’s access should have been forbidden.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Gaarder's novel, Sophie’s World, was an enjoyable experience from many points of view.
<br>
<br>Of the many reason why that is, I would like to begin with how this novel was built as a vessel for introducing the reader to the basics of philosophy. For me, the lessons Sophie received in her mysterious letters from the unknown Albert were a nice recap of all the philosophical concepts discussed by Sartre, Descartes, Spinoza, and so on, and let’s not forget that there was also a very nice chapter on Freud that was diluted for the sake of Sophie’s understanding. This chapter spoke about a boy who dreamt about balloons.
<br>
<br>The magic and the mystery were also nicely interweaved with the plot.
<br>
<br>Some strange letters are exchanged between the two, making them question whether their existence is indeed a reality or whether they are living in someone else’s story. Clues to this are spread throughout the book.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend this book? Definitely.
<br>
<br>It’s a must, especially if you enjoy philosophical writing.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">What more can one say about HERE I AM? There are so many reasons why I love Foer’s novel. First of all, this book is an unceasing hymn of complacency, and a wild celebration of small joyful moments
<br>
<br>Lately, I started to look more behind Hineni (HERE I AM). The voice of God speaks slowly to us, but we are too busy, we have so many things to do, and we ignore Him. We refuse to hear when we are asked "Ayyekkah?" (Where are you). Silence is a comfortable excuse, and thus God’s question remains a frozen echo through our lives. I’m just in love with how Foer took this idea and examined how we answer it in our times. How present are we? How present is Jacob Bloch in his life? Does he observe when his marriage is on a pile of gunpowder ready to explode? That's just the second reason why I recommend this book.
<br>
<br>The third one? Well… the taste of loss, a sensation that is so strong that I cannot describe, but YOU will feel it while reading the end of the story.</p>
