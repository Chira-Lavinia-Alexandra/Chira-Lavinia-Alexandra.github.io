                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5"><strong>A shirt of remembrance- First part</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">One night while I was reading, I lifted my eyes from the book, and there it was – on the chair – my dear old shirt. It was flung across the chair in an offhand fashion, with one sleeve dangling, almost touching the floor. I felt sorry for how I had just left it there when I changed my clothing. It was a desolate sight.<br>
<br>
I stood up, and I took a hanger from the closet to set it properly this time. I wanted to preserve it for as long as possible, and folds were something I ardently wished to avoid. When I touched the embroidery, memories flashed before my eyes.  I remembered seeing my mom wearing this shirt in one photograph at home. It happened during her high school graduation ceremony. She bought it for this special occasion, and she looked so happy in it. Her face was beaming with joy, something I haven’t seen her expressing in the past years.
<br>
<br>My mother hasn’t worn the shirt in decades, and it has now been passed down to me. This makes me the second owner of the shirt. I have worn it during job interviews, at dates with my fiancée, and at church. I simply love it. The softness of the material and the delicate flower embroidery make me feel more powerful and feminine. I felt so confident in it.
<br>
<br>One September night, I went on a date with my fiancée. We ate delicious pasta, and we had a hot lava cake. Honestly, that date was perfect. I pampered myself with some skin lotions, and I dressed in this shirt and a pair of baggy gray suiting pants. I looked the way Huckleberry Finn would have looked if he had turned classy all of a sudden, and I felt drop-dead gorgeous.<br><br>
The pure white of the shirt has faded away in time, and now it has more of a vintage look. You can tell it is not brand new. Even so, time has favoured it and has given it more elegance. The yellowish buttons are small and dainty. Every time I button it up, I get the dark academia vibes. I feel like I am the main character of someone’s non-fiction historical book. Who knows? In the mornings, I could lobby for people’s rights, like Eugenia Phelan. In the afternoons, I could write some secret reports at the library, and at night I could meet a spy for a fancy dinner downtown.
<br>
<br>
This shirt is the oldest thing I have in my possession. Bought more than 26 years ago, it is still in good shape. It is a white van Olfen shirt with bishop sleeves and rose-like embroidery. The shirt is soft at the touch and has a nice mixture between polyester and cotton. Not to mention that it has a pleasant smell from my lilac body cream. The role of this object was clear as daylight. However, I was curious about its destiny. If I were to be careful enough, maybe I would get to pass it on to my children in the future. If not, who knows?! Maybe, I could make a decorative pillowcase from it, or clothes for dolls, or I could simply throw it away.
<br>
<br>Now I put it on the wood hanger. I gently arranged the sleeves and the collar and I set it back on my wardrobe’s door. The washing day for white clothes will be in two days. A refreshing wash may prove to do it good. I considered taking it to a professional cleaning store some time this year, maybe this way the white could get whiter, and the fibre texture could be rejuvenated a little.

                    <h3 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>To shirt, or not to shirt- Second part</strong></h3>
                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Here I am again, dangling my arm above the floor in a tired attempt of cheering myself up. The blue chair on which I am currently resting is way comfier than the one made out of wood on which she used to set me in her old apartment. I am as happy as a clam because she moved. The entire building was a shack. It was surprising that that so-called building could endure the storms, and those neighbors… An old Irish’s mouth is a holy church door compared to those people’s language. Her new place is a real blessing. It is modest, not luxurious, but at least it is clean, cockroaches are no longer escaping from underneath the floor, and I have my own place to rest.
<br>
<br>           She opens the window, and a soft, cold summer breeze started to tingle each of my fibers. It reminds me of my beginning. I grew up on a cotton plantation together with my mamma and my brothers and cousins. The weather was constantly changing. I started to grow, bloom, and be as soft as a cloud. I remember that was the exact moment when everything changed dramatically. A huge green machine started to eat all of us. Eat the ground. Eat my family. It tore me apart from my mamma and from the sweet sun-kissed field.
<br>
<br>            The next day I woke up in an industrialized room. I got carded, combed, and blended. It was the first time when I experienced pure confusion. What were those people doing to me?  There was nothing like the sweet loving nature. They even put chemicals on me, and they bleached me.
<br>
<br>            All I remember is that a really nice lady, with the gentlest fingers, started to give me a shape. But soon after she started to sting me with a machine… Oh, the pain. I got to be transformed into something with a purpose. I was going to be used. I heard the lady saying that she wished to have something like me. Even so, that purpose was not worth all this pain. Why suffer this much? What is the actual use of it?   
<br>
<br>            I got to stay on a shelf for a few weeks. I looked at how all the other shirts got sold, but not me. I stayed there for some months. One day a young lady came into the shop and took me home. We were a perfect match. She chose me for her graduation ceremony, and everyone complimented my embroideries. Weeks after that occasion, she stopped wearing me. I was banned on the top shelf. Who was I? Napoleon? I saw nothing but darkness for decades.
<br>
<br>            One day, she had gripped me and handed me over to a mini-her. Oh my, she was old. Her daughter looked just like her, but her hair was just as black as the nights spent in the cotton fields. I had a good feeling about this. She wore me during some important meetings. They call them “job interviews”. I never understood the fuss about those stressful situations.
<br>
<br>            Once she wore me on a date with some friends, I really hope we’ll have similar experiences. They laughed a lot, and I heard some of the best jokes in the past decades. The guy she calls her “fiancée” is really funny, and he looks like the younger version of Bill Nighy. No surprise she looks so tired right now, after all that fun. I am not even mad that she flung me across this chair in such an offhand fashion. That restaurant was really nice. It’s called after the writer of The Master and Margarita, Bulga…Bluko… oh yeah, Bulgakov. I wish I had a mouth to enjoy the food they ate. It looked appetizing.
<br>
<br>            Creeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaak. Here we go again! Back to the wardrobe. See you on our next adventure, young lady!</p>
