</strong></p><div><strong><br></strong></div><p></p></h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-7">Corruption, abuse, law disobedience and criticism... the pure Romanian spirit, unveiled by a policeman in the most hilarious way possible: Flash-uri din sens opus, by Marian Godină. The book is a collection of mostly funny true tales gathered by Godină througout his years as a patrol and traffic officer, which expose the most sensitive aspects of law enforcement and every day life. <br><br>The book is a light read and the stories are told in an amusing manner, although the author does not shy away from trivial language. To me, it was like living the moments myself, with all the characters involved having a natural, uncensored jargon, but revealing the true Romanian nature. Some of the stories are sad, but that does not take away from its mainly cheerful tone. <br><br>I enjoyed the book very much mostly because it takes all the drama out and turns it into fun and laughter. Life is hard... let’s make it funny!&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-7">This is the second book I’ve read from Elif Shafak and just as with the first one, I am grateful for the reader experience she provides. <br>Shafak has a way with language that is reminiscent of Morrison or Rushdie, both vivid and foreign, the language of the dispossessed, the traveler, the immigrant of one’s current reality.<br> <br>She herself has said she feels as if she were constantly moving between lands, languages and nationalities, only to never arrive at the final destination, which may or may not be attainable. <br>With Peri, or Azur, the language of the perpetually perplexed stays true to Shafak’s style and one is kept constantly wondrous as the reading progresses. Time, space or concepts become open to introspection and the magical realism is so subtle that it is organic for the reader to find themselves taken along for the ride while reading.<br> <br>A greater critic than I would probably find it faulty to have read such a well written story. I, however, will rate it with the greats and consider myself blessed by the endeavor.<br><br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8132522-alex" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Goodreads</a></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-7">Do you know that moment when you watch a man eat a cherry tomato and think ‘damn, I’d tap that’, cause i sure don’t, but apparently HiLaRy has ‘never seen a more sensual gesture than Sam’s lips slowly closing around that tiny red orb’.
<br>
<br>Hi. I’m Amy and welcome to my TED talk. Today we will be discussing Moon Showers and how it is probably the worst thing i have ever read. Let’s begin. I read this book in one sitting. Why, you might ask? Because i hate myself.
<br>
<br>So characters: Sam is 30% a Civil War re-enactor, 20% cowboy farmer who has to get over the death of his wife and 50% I’m just here to protect my woman. Hilary is 20% rich city girl, but not really, 20% i wanna be an independent woman who don’t need no man but I’ll still jump from one man to the other because oMg ThE AtTrAcTIon Is ToO StROnG, and then like 60% I’m just kinda here so the main guy can watch me shower naked  in the garden with a garden hose. Sexy.<br>
<br>For some reason, Hilary keeps comparing Sam to a warlock, like that’s the sexiest thing she’s ever known and he is constantly surprised at how SpEcIaL she is, when in fact she is an actual brick. 
<br>The plot is as complex as said brick and I think i might have nightmares with the final page where I think the point was for it to be romantic but I somehow perceived it as a ritual: clears throat
<br>starts reading in a sultry voice
<br>‘i need to see you tonight. Not just your body, but your eyes. They are the mirrors of your soul and i need to believe that you’re really mine now, he said, baring his own soul to this woman, his mate (OMG MATE). She nodded. We’re partners, she whispered. My strengths will complement yours, and between us there are no weaknesses.’<br> 
<br>And so they went and conquered the world with their evil plan. Just add an evil chuckle at the end of that line. Do it. You’ll see what i mean. Oh, and at some point she fights off a raccoon and its babies and then 5 minutes later they get it on for the first time. That’s what I call ambiance.
<br>Finally (because i have a life and a job and I can’t sit here writing reviews for hours), the writing. I will only say one thing. This was on the first page and if you break it up, it sounds like the worst poem ever written. So, page one, Moon showers: taps microphone
<br>‘Count the flowers.
<br>Count the people and people parts,
<br>Eyes, elbows 
<br>Flapping lips.
<br>Don’t think of the larger picture.
<br>Not yet.
<br>Twenty Reenactors. 
<br>Twenty plus three was Sarah’s age.
<br>Twenty plus eight was his own.
<br>And twenty years plus twenty,
<br>And maybe more after that,
<br>Stretched ahead of him.
<br>If only...’
<br>Eat your heart out, Emily Dickinson. 
<br>There is nothing more attractive that ‘flapping lips’.
<br>That’s all I have time for. If you have any questions, leave them down below. I will be glad to diss this book more. I have lost my faith in literature, writing and publishing houses and with that, I bid you adieu.
<br>
<br>Ps. If you ever find more Laura Phillips books, tell me, I will buy all of them and read them. To love a cowboy is one in particular I’m searching for. It sounds hysterical.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***<br><br>You can find more reviews written by this sweet moonflower on her <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112210180-amy " class="text-primary" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> page. It was a delight to have her contributing with this review. Now I want to read Moon Showers to experience the rant.</p>

                            <strong>Petru Fistoc - <em>Gertrude and Claudius</em> by John Updyke</strong></h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-7">Remember Hamlet? Not this way, you don’t!...<br><br>	While I’m sure you’re fairly familiar with Shakespeare’s hero, I’ll bet you a round of fancy beers that you never thought of Hamlet as a young adult with a history of neglect in childhood. Or as an arrogant prick.<br> <br>	Updike’s approach on the story is a three-part novel that borrows from the known sources of Shakespeare’s Hamlet: a twelfth-century Latin text, a French Renaissance adaptation of the old Danish legend and an earlier version of the play that was presumably acquired by Shakespeare’s theatrical company. However, despite naming his characters based on the sources above, Updike reimagines the tragedy from the perspective of Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude, and follows the plot through her reluctantly marrying Old Hamlet, becoming the neglected wife in a medieval royal couple, projecting the neglect onto her son, Young Hamlet, and having a love affair with her brother-in-law that climaxes into the assasination of the king.<br><br>Pretty much everything that happens before Shakespeare even begins to move things around in his Hamlet… Not to mention that Hamlet himself is offstage for most of the novel, neglected by his mother, or off to university, refusing to come home.<br><br>It was definitely worth reading for me. And not only because it shifted my sympathy from Hamlet toward the couple traditionally viewed as the villains, but also because the dialogue portrays a beautiful clash between Norse paganism and early Christianity, speculating on how this might have shaped the mentalities of medieval Europe.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 mb-0 display-7">The Thief Lord is a children's novel written by Cornelia Funke. The book follows the story of two young orphan brothers, Prosper and Boniface, dumped in the care of a cruel aunt and uncle. The boys flee to Venice, a city that reminds them of their late mother, all because they are to be separated by their aunt, who only wants to adopt the younger brother, Bo.
<br>As the story starts out, the reader is introduced to a gang of young urchins and their masked leader, Scipio, who is an archetype of Robin Hood, as well as a private detective whose nose is out for the boys.
<br>The writing isn’t particularly special but it still, the narrative does a fine job at painting very well defined characters and above that engulfs everything in a very spectacular scenery, giving the readers all the essential nouns that can transpose one among the smelly watery canals, arching bridges and old crumbling buildings of Venice. It is for sure a book that will want to make you check on a flight to Italy as soon as possible 
<br>Prosper’s and Bo’s relationship is what sits at the core of it all. It is a tale of brotherly love, of being close to one another in times of need. The story will not fail you when it comes to caring for its protagonists as they are looking out for each other through the perils that lurk among the dark alleyways.     
<br>While I thoroughly enjoyed unraveling this tale, my interest started to fade away around chapter 50 where the notion of magic was abruptly introduced. The elements of fantasy did not sit well with me as the book was doing a fantastic job on it’s own.
<br>This book is a decent children’s story that entertains, but it's definitely not a classic, still, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the likes of  Peter Pan, Robin Hood and Oliver Twist.&nbsp;<br></p>
